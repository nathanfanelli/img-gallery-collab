20200304 KW, 
Applied some css grid to the gallery items and added in some manga placeholders. 
They are all the same size. Added some starter code for the media queries & navbar. 
I think you could design the navbar similar to the one on your website. 
Pretty rusty on the web design. 
I'll start doing the path again on CA, because I felt a little blind here.

Utilized a flexbox trick to push the footer down to the bottom. Here is the link for the article I used as reference: https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/.
Added two media queries styles to break the image gallery display to 2 and 1 columns and the footer to display in 2 columns. Grid made these media queries VERY simple with minimal code. 
Changed image size just for reference. We'll want to find different images that better suit Kendell's art exhibit motif.

Testing pushing changes to my branch from VS Code. 
Imported art gallery photos of Richard Avedon portraits. (https://www.avedonfoundation.org/the-work)
Imported fonts from google fonts and applied to text. Added color highlight when hovering over links. 
Found potential flip animation for photos. (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_flip_card.asp)
